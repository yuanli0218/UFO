# UFO

## Overview
The project is to provide the user a front-end tool for a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. Using mainly Javascript and HTML/CSS, the UI enables the users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results
The table lists all UFO sightings after the user selects multiple criteria and dynamically updates when criteria are changed.

## Summary
The drawback is the input of criterion is case sensitive. For example, it only allows 'us', instead of 'US' as the country.

Further improvements could be leveraging more data of UFO sightings. Currently, the 'backend' is just data.js with a few data points that cover only US over a certain period of time. It'd be great if it could link to database where data gets frequently updated.
